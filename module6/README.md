# C++ Casts
In C++, there are several ways to cast between different types. In this set of exercises, we will explore different types of casts and their uses.

## Exercise 00: Conversion of Scalar Types
In this exercise, we will explore the use of static_cast to convert between scalar types. We will also use const_cast to remove the constness of an object.

### Keywords
- static_cast
- const_cast

## Exercise 01: Serialization
In this exercise, we will explore the use of reinterpret_cast to serialize and deserialize objects. We will also use dynamic_cast to identify the real type of an object.

### Keywords
- reinterpret_cast
- dynamic_cast
- serialize
- deserialize

## Exercise 02: Identify Real Type
In this exercise, we will explore the use of dynamic_cast to identify the real type of an object.

### Keywords
- dynamic_cast
- identify
