# Cpp All Modules

### Introduction

In this programming education, the aim is to learn the fundamental topics in the C++ language. Although there are many language options to learn programming, learning in C++ offers many advantages such as flexibility in memory management, a powerful object-oriented model, high efficiency, platform independence, and usability for almost any type of application.

This education covers the topics of subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, and C++ casts. Subtype polymorphism is an important concept in object-oriented programming and is used when different subtypes inherit from the same superclass. Abstract classes are important for dealing with the properties of abstract classes, and abstract classes can be used in many subclasses. Interfaces create a contract between different classes, especially in cases where code sharing is required.

The C++ casts topic covers the conversion of one data type to another. Four different cast types are used in this topic: static_cast, const_cast, reinterpret_cast, and dynamic_cast. These cast types are used to safely convert between different data types.

In each module, there are example codes and exercises to facilitate the understanding of the topics. These exercises are designed to reinforce the learned topics. In addition, debugging techniques and good coding practices are also taught so that students can learn about possible errors they may encounter and how to fix them.

This education is ideal for those who want to learn programming, especially those who want to learn programming in C++. The topics learned in each module can also be used in real-world applications, so we believe that the skills learned will be valuable in students' future careers.
