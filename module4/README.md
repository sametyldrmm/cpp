# Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces

## Exercise 00: Polymorphism
This exercise focuses on subtype polymorphism, which is a way to achieve polymorphism through inheritance. In this exercise, you will create an Animal class and two subtypes, Dog and Cat.

## Exercise 01: I donâ€™t want to set the world on fire
In this exercise, you will learn about memory leaks and how to avoid them. You will implement a class called Brain and integrate it into the Animal class created in Exercise 00. The Brain class will store a string that represents a thought, and the Animal class will have a pointer to an instance of Brain. You will need to ensure that the memory allocated for the Brain instance is properly managed and deallocated when necessary.

## Exercise 02: Abstract class
This exercise introduces the concept of abstract classes, which are classes that cannot be instantiated and only serve as a base for other classes. You will create an abstract Animal class with a pure virtual function, and two subtypes, Dog and Cat, that inherit from the Animal class.

## Exercise 03: Interface & recap
In this final exercise, you will learn about interfaces, which are similar to abstract classes but only contain pure virtual functions. You will create an Idea interface and modify the Brain class to implement it. You will also do a recap of the concepts covered in the previous exercises.
