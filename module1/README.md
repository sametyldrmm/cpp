# 42 Piscine C++ - Day 01 Project

This project is the second day of an intensive C++ programming language training series designed to teach the fundamentals of C++. These assignments are completed by working intensely for a set amount of time, typically two or three weeks.

The focus of Day 01 is the creation and use of class instances, dynamic memory allocation and management, and reference-to-pointer conversion. Below is a list summarizing the scope and content of each assignment.

## Assignments

### Assignment 00 - Your Very First Class
In this assignment, you will create a class, including a constructor and destructor, to manage the behavior of an instance of that class.

### Assignment 01 - Memory Allocation
In this assignment, you will learn about dynamic memory allocation and management using new and delete. You will use these concepts to create a program that manipulates a string.

### Assignment 02 - Deep Copy
In this assignment, you will learn about the concept of "deep copying" and how to implement it in your own classes. You will create a program that copies instances of a class and explore how the behavior of the copied instance can be managed.

### Rush00 - Space Shooter
For the final assignment of Day 01, you will work in a group to create a simple space shooter game using the concepts you have learned in the previous assignments.

### Installation
This project contains .cpp files in separate folders for each assignment. Each assignment folder includes a Makefile, so you can easily compile each assignment.

To complete the assignments, you will need a C++ compiler (such as g++) and the Make tool. Before running these assignments, you will need to clone the project onto your computer by following the instructions in the readme.md file.

This is a summary of the Day 01 project. For more detailed information on the scope and content of each assignment, please refer to the PDF file or the readme.md file.
