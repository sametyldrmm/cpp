# CPP Module 01: Memory Allocation and References

This module is designed to provide an introduction to memory allocation and references in C++ programming. The module covers the basics of pointers, memory allocation, and references in C++.

The module is divided into four parts, each with its own exercise that covers a specific aspect of memory allocation and references:

## Exercise 00: Memory Allocation
In this exercise, you will create a program that allocates memory dynamically using the new keyword and deallocates it using the delete keyword. This exercise is designed to help you get familiar with dynamic memory allocation in C++.

You will be provided with a program that uses the new keyword to allocate memory for a string and an integer. Your task is to modify the program to deallocate the memory using the delete keyword.

## Exercise 01: Reference
In this exercise, you will create a program that demonstrates the use of references in C++. This exercise is designed to help you get familiar with the concept of references in C++.

You will be provided with a program that defines a variable and a reference to that variable. Your task is to modify the program to demonstrate the use of references in C++.

## Exercise 02: Pointers to Members
In this exercise, you will create a program that uses pointers to members. This exercise is designed to help you get familiar with the concept of pointers to members in C++.

You will be provided with a program that defines a Contact class and two member functions that set and get the values of the Contact object. Your task is to modify the program to use pointers to members to set and get the values of the Contact object.

## Exercise 03: Serialisation
In this exercise, you will create a program that serializes a Contact class using binary serialization. This exercise is designed to help you get familiar with binary serialization and data storage in C++.

You will be provided with a program that defines a Contact class and a function that serializes a Contact object to a file. Your task is to modify the program to serialize the Contact object using binary serialization.

Each exercise in this module builds on the previous exercise and will help you gain a solid understanding of memory allocation and references in C++ programming. By the end of this module, you should have a good understanding of basic memory allocation and reference concepts in C++ and be ready to tackle more advanced topics.

## Note
The exercises mentioned here are grouped according to my personal preference, and are not necessarily the same as those in the official PDF. When I referred to "3 sets", I meant 3 groups of exercises, with each group consisting of 2 or 3 individual exercises. Therefore, there are a total of 6 exercises, which are to be completed in 3 sets.
