# Inheritance

## Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!
- In this exercise, you are asked to create subclasses of the ClapTrap class.
- The ClapTrap class defines the characteristics of a main character. Using this class, you are asked to create two different subclasses named "FragTrap" and "ScavTrap".
- The FragTrap class defines the characteristics of a robotic character, while the ScavTrap class defines the characteristics of a character.

## Exercise 01: Serena, my love!
- In this exercise, you are asked to create a subclass named "NinjaTrap".
- NinjaTrap class defines the properties of a character and should inherit from the FragTrap class.

## Exercise 02: Repetitive work

- In this exercise, you are asked to write the "copy constructor" and "assignment operator" functions of the ClapTrap class. 
- Additionally, you are also required to add some functions to the "FragTrap" and "ScavTrap" classes.

## Exercise 03: Now itâ€™s weird!

- In this exercise, you are asked to learn how to deal with the "Diamond problem". 
- This is a conflict that arises when the same class is inherited by multiple subclasses.
- In this exercise, you are required to create three different classes named "A", "B", and "C" and a class named "D" that inherits from these three classes.
