# 42 Piscine C++ - Day 00 Project
This project is part of an intensive C++ programming language training series designed to teach the fundamentals of C++. These assignments are completed by working intensely for a set amount of time, typically two or three weeks.

On the first day of this assignment series, you will be introduced to the basic concepts of C++ programming. Below is a list summarizing the scope and content of each assignment.

## Assignments

### Assignment 00 - Namespace, Class, Member Functions, stdio stream, Initialization Lists, static, const, and lots of basic stuff
In this assignment, you will learn about the C++ class concept and class members, initialization lists, constant data types, and static member variables. Additionally, you will use standard input/output streams such as std::cout and std::cin.

### Assignment 01 - Memory allocation, References, Pointers to members, File streams
In this assignment, you will learn about memory allocation (new and delete), references, member pointers, and file streams. You will also create a simple contact management application using the concepts you learned.

### Assignment 02 - Ad-hoc polymorphism, operators overload and orthodox canonical classes
In this assignment, you will explore operator overloading, creating customized classes, and using various operators (= and <<) by overloading them. Additionally, you will learn about the concept of "canonical form" to manage your written classes more accurately.

## Installation
This project contains .cpp files in separate folders for each assignment. Each assignment folder includes a Makefile, so you can easily compile each assignment.

To complete the assignments, you will need a C++ compiler (such as g++) and the Make tool. Before running these assignments, you will need to clone the project onto your computer by following the instructions in the readme.md file.

This is a summary of the Day 00 project. For more detailed information on the scope and content of each assignment, please refer to the PDF file or the readme.md file.
