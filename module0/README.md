# CPP Module 00: Introduction to C++

This module is designed to provide an introduction to C++ programming for beginners. The module covers the basics of C++ programming, including its syntax and fundamental programming concepts.

The module is divided into four parts, each with its own exercise that covers a specific aspect of C++ programming:

## Exercise 00: My First Program
In this exercise, you will create a simple "Hello, World!" program. This exercise is designed to help you get familiar with the C++ syntax and the structure of a basic program.

## Exercise 01: Megaphone
In this exercise, you will write a program that takes a string as input and prints it in uppercase. This program simulates shouting through a megaphone. This exercise is designed to help you get familiar with basic input/output operations in C++.

## Exercise 02: Account Class
In this exercise, you will create a basic bank account class. The class will have a balance field and basic functionality for depositing and withdrawing money. This exercise is designed to help you get familiar with the concept of classes in C++.

## Exercise 03: Contact Class
In this exercise, you will create a basic contact class. The class will have fields for the contact's first name, last name, nickname, phone number, and darkest secret. This exercise is designed to help you get familiar with more advanced concepts of C++ classes, including constructors and access control.

Each exercise in this module builds on the previous exercise and will help you gain a solid foundation in C++ programming. By the end of this module, you should have a good understanding of basic C++ programming concepts and be ready to tackle more advanced topics.
