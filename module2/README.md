# Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form
This project explores the topics of ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical class form. It is divided into four exercises.

## Exercise 00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
This exercise introduces the concept of the Orthodox Canonical Class Form and asks us to create a class following this format. We are given a header file that defines the class interface and we must implement the class methods in a separate implementation file.

## Exercise 01: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
This exercise builds on the previous exercise and asks us to create a class for fixed-point numbers that overloads several operators to allow mathematical operations to be performed on these numbers.

## Exercise 02: Now weâ€™re talking
This exercise introduces the concept of ad-hoc polymorphism and asks us to overload the << operator to allow objects of our fixed-point class to be output to the console.

## Exercise 03: BSP
This exercise explores the concept of Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) trees and asks us to write a program that generates a simple 2D BSP tree and outputs it to the console.
