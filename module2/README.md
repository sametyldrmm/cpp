# 42 Piscine C++ - Day 02 Project
This project is the third day of an intensive C++ programming language training series designed to teach the fundamentals of C++. These assignments are completed by working intensely for a set amount of time, typically two or three weeks.

The focus of Day 02 is the use of ad hoc polymorphism, operator overload, and canonical classes in C++. Below is a list summarizing the scope and content of each assignment.

## Assignments

### Assignment 00 - Fixed Point
In this assignment, you will create a fixed-point numeric class to represent rational numbers using ad hoc polymorphism and operator overload.

### Assignment 01 - Fixed Point
In this assignment, you will continue working on the Fixed Point numeric class created in Assignment 00. You will implement additional functions, including mathematical operations, comparison operators, and type conversion.

### Assignment 02 - Account
In this assignment, you will create a simple banking system using C++ classes. You will create classes for an account, user, and bank to simulate simple banking operations, such as opening an account, depositing and withdrawing money, and viewing the balance.

### Rush01 - Spaceship Game
For the final assignment of Day 02, you will work in a group to create a simple spaceships game using the concepts you have learned in the previous assignments.

## Installation
This project contains .cpp files in separate folders for each assignment. Each assignment folder includes a Makefile, so you can easily compile each assignment.

To complete the assignments, you will need a C++ compiler (such as g++) and the Make tool. Before running these assignments, you will need to clone the project onto your computer by following the instructions in the readme.md file.

This is a summary of the Day 02 project. For more detailed information on the scope and content of each assignment, please refer to the PDF file or the readme.md file.
